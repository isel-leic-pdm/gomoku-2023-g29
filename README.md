+ The game is played on a <u>15x15</u> or <u>19x19</u> board named **Traditional** or **Renju**, respectively.  
+ The players can only play against each other in wireless.

### The "How To Use" Part

> [!TIP]
> Open the console at `.\GOMOKU\app\libs`, execute `java -jar Gomoku.main.jar`. This will start the API to which the webpage and the app will send the requests to. Then initiate the App and either Login or Register yourself to start playing.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once you press *`Play`* you can choose your gamemode(*`Traditional`* or *`Renju`*). If there's no one on the auto-queue the app will return you to the home screen but also add you to the *`Wait List`*. You can try again until someone also presses *`Play`*. If not, you'll stay in the menu and in the wait list forever. Totally intended feature by the way.
